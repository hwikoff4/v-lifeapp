-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;

-- Recreate policies with proper permissions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert profiles"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO service_role
  WITH CHECK (true);
