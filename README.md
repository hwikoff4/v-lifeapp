## Production Readiness Notes

- Onboarding now focuses purely on selecting a primary goal— the experimental AI body visualizer and its API route have been retired for launch.
- Dashboard plan refresh, tools, nutrition, workouts, grocery list, community, and subscription flows are wired to Supabase so state persists across sessions.
- Feedback actions (app ratings, referrals, subscriptions, weight tracking, progress photos, etc.) write directly to the database, making the experience fully live-ready.

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository
